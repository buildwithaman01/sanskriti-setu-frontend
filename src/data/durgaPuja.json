  "description": "Durga Puja is one of the most famous festivals of India, especially celebrated in West Bengal, Assam, Odisha, Tripura, and across the world by Bengali communities. Dedicated to Goddess Durga, the festival symbolizes the triumph of good over evil, as she defeated the demon king Mahishasura.\n\nThe celebration is known for its beautiful Durga idols, grand pandals (decorated pavilions), traditional rituals, cultural programs, and festive food. Families and communities come together to offer prayers, enjoy music, dance, and admire the artistic creativity of pandal designs.\n\nOn the final day, Vijayadashami (Dussehra), idols are immersed in rivers or water bodies, marking the Goddess’s return to her divine abode. Beyond its religious significance, Durga Puja has become a cultural extravaganza and heritage festival, showcasing the rich traditions, art, and unity of Indian society.\n\nWhether you experience it in Kolkata or anywhere else, Durga Puja is not just a festival – it’s an emotion that blends devotion, culture, and celebration.",
